# 📊 Customer Segmentation with K-Means

This is my third project from the RISE Data Science Internship by **Tamizhan Skills**.

## 🎯 Goal
To group mall customers based on their spending habits and income using **K-Means clustering**. This helps businesses understand different types of customers better.

## 📁 Data Used
`mallcustomers.csv` with:
- Age  
- Annual Income (k$)  
- Spending Score (1-100)

## 🔧 What I Did
- Preprocessed the data and scaled it  
- Used the **Elbow Method** to find the best number of clusters  
- Applied KMeans to segment customers  
- Visualized the results with a scatter plot

## 🧠 Key Outcome
Found 5 unique customer segments — great for targeting offers or marketing strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## 🙌 Thanks to
Big thanks to **Tamizhan Skills** and **Raghul Prakash** (Founder) for guiding me through this. It was a great experience working on this as part of the **RISE Internship**!
